Been smashing my head against a wall and on stackoverflow trying to complete the final two requirements. Unfortunately my attempts at implementation of it üÖ±orked my app, so this is a "stable" version for now, hopefully I will be able to get a working app that meets all the requirements soon, watch for some commits as I fiddle around with the code hoping it works üôÉ.

## Build
```
cd <PROJECT_FOLDER>
meteor npm install --save @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/daygrid
meteor npm install --save bootstrap
meteor add less
meteor
